## Data Description:

A set of portfolio companies trading data from emerging markets. Each company stock is provided in different sheets. Each market's operating days varies based on the country of the company and the market the stocks are exchanged.

## Project Description

- Predicted stock price valuations on a daily,weekly, and monthly basis. Recommended BUY, HOLD, SELL decisions. Recommended strategy of max capital returns and min losses. Bollinger bands. 
- Facebook Prophet, ARIMAX, LSTM, GRU, TPOT, Bayesian Optimization, Hyper Optimization, Calibration Classifier. 
- I found a solution for TimeSeries and Classification predictions for forecasting the recommendations. I would optimize the strategy and model for better results. In general, the recommended strategy will work based on predictions and bollinger bands crosspoints. For better results, always refer to better model optimizations.
