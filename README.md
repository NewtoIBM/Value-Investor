- Predicted stock price valuations on a daily,weely, and monthly basis. Recommended BUY, HOLD, SELL desicions. Recommended strategy of max capital returns and min losses. Bollinger bands. 
- Facebook Prophet, ARIMAX, LSTM, GRU, TPOT, Bayesian Optimization, Hyper Optimization, Calibration Classifier. 
- I found a solution for TimeSeries  and Classification predictions for forecasting the recommendations. I would optimize the strategy and model for better results. I general, the recommended atrategy will work based on predictions and bollinger bands crosspoints.  For better results, always refer for better model optimizations.
